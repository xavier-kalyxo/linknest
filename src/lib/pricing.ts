/**
 * Single source of truth for customer-facing plan copy.
 *
 * The pricing page and the marketing homepage previously kept two hardcoded
 * copies of these lists, which had already drifted apart — and several entries
 * described features the code does not implement. Deriving the numbers from
 * PLAN_MATRIX means a limit change cannot silently contradict the marketing.
 *
 * Claims deliberately NOT made here, because they are not built:
 *   - "Unlimited links"  — blocks are capped (see max_blocks_per_page)
 *   - "animations"       — no animated button styles exist
 *   - "referrers"/"geo"  — analytics reports views and link clicks only
 *   - "free trial"       — checkout creates no trial period
